      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        We rent property for vacationers that help prevent climate change.
        Our Rental is a great resource to see how to live organic, use               
        sustainable energy, and enjoy the earth. With river trail biking,             
        local gardening and groceries, and close to air-port convenience we           
        hope that we can help you adopt environmental activism and still             
        enjoy all the modern conveniences of the day at Bowers B & B.
        
        Bowers B & B offers a free organic breakfast grown in our gardens, 
        the convenience of free electric transit (for up to 4 people) from 
        and to the airport, and enjoyable nature adventures at next to no cost. 
        With 14 mile friendly bike-rides that let you experience the nature of 
        Sundance canyon, there is little else you will want from this relaxed stay. 
        (Pet friendly stays are available at our Bed and Breakfast for an extra charge.)   
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>

        I want the name and logo to look like a mongrammed towel. I want the
        individuals that stay at Bowers B&B to feel like they are special
        because they chose to stay at our eco-friendly guest house. 5 star
        treatment for those that stay and 5 star treatment to the our planet as well.

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: :

      <p>
        I used the pairings feature in Google Fonts and really liked the way
        these two fonts complimented one-another.
