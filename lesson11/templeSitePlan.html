        We build and manage specialized hotel accommodations near temple locations 
        of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around the world. The 
        owner-operated company caters to temple workers, patrons, and their families 
        by providing specialized services and accommodations that meet the needs of 
        those patrons that are traveling or getting married near temple sites. The 
        hotel accommodations and services are available to anyone willing to abide 
        by the terms and policies outlined by the company. The overall goal of the 
        website project is to promote and provide information about the specialized 
        services that this hotel chain offers to meet the needs of temple patrons 
        who come to serve in the temple or who participate in events such as sealings, 
        weddings, receptions, and youth trips. We want to reflect the Church culture 
        and be designed to support a temple oriented theme as well as the concept of 
        being a haven of comfort and accessibility."
