    <h1>Elsinore Economic Expression</h1>
    <p>A commercial connection for "Little Denmark's" residents, and professionals.</p>
    <h2>Site Purpose:</h2>
    <p>"As the Elsinore Chamber of Commerce, we recognize every small community progresses to a point in growth
        where the demand for more local resources being accessable is the priority. This can mean a closer
        grocery store, closer hardware retail, plumbers, or closer health care. Elsinore and her people are
        no exception and we want to create a Chamber community full of diverse, reliable, and unified businesses as
        are needed. Our commerce community can be a great resourse to all that visit, live, and work here.
        Are you someone who could expand our community by providing a local trade or business to those around you?
        The Elsinore Chamber of Commerce team knows the difference you can make for it's citizens, your own family,
        and the town's future. The goal may seem far reaching, but every labor counts in "Little Denmark".
        What impact can you have?
